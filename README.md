mac-cleanup
===========


cleanup.sh
----------

A little script to delete some files (xcode related mostly) to make some room in the hdd.

It is just a little bash script that deleted ios simlulator related files. Hopefully I'll improve it whenever I've time.

update.sh
---------

A simple script to update my computer's various programs.
This script can be added to crontab 

At the moment it updates: 
  * vim programs
  * brew updates
  * brew upgrates
  * a cleanup after all operations
